# Face Detection using HOG and CNN

Code for face detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Dlib. This repository demonstrates two robust approaches for facial detection and highlights their unique strengths.

## What is HOG?
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for object detection. It:
- Extracts gradient orientation histograms from an image.
- Works efficiently for detecting faces in various conditions.
- Lightweight and fast, making it suitable for real-time applications.

### Advantages:
- Computationally inexpensive.
- Does not require extensive training data.
- Works well for well-lit and moderately complex images.

## What is CNN?
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning architectures that excel at image recognition tasks. In this project, the CNN model detects faces with:
- Higher accuracy compared to traditional methods.
- Robustness to variations in lighting, scale, and complex backgrounds.

### Advantages:
- Highly accurate, especially for challenging scenarios.
- Learns features directly from data without manual feature extraction.
- Scales well for large and diverse datasets.
